Ticketing System Readme

Welcome to My IT Help Desk Ticketing System. This is simple program that I have created as part of My study curriculum. It can help to manage customer support tickets efficiently in a front-line IT customer service support environment. Whether you're a beginner developer or an experienced professional, this readme should be able to guide you through using and understanding the system. 

Getting Started
To get started, simply run the main.py file in your Python environment. This will launch the Ticketing System in your terminal or command prompt. Using the Ticketing System

Creating a Ticket: 
• When prompted, enter the details of the ticket, such as the staff ID, creator's name, customer contact email address, and a description of the issue. 
• If the issue is related to a password change, you can simply type “Password change” into the “description” field, and the system will automatically generate a login code and password based on the customer's name and ticket number. 
• After entering the ticket details, provide a solution description and indicate whether the issue has been rectified.

Searching for a Ticket: 
• If you need to search for an existing ticket select “2” in the main menu. When prompted, provide the ticket number. (The Initial ticket created will be 2001) 
• The system will display the details of the ticket if it exists, allowing you to review or reopen it if needed.

Ticket Status: 
• Tickets have two possible statuses: "Open" or "Closed". 
• If the issue has been rectified, the status changes to "Closed". Otherwise, it remains "Open" or is set to "To Solve" in the ticket statistics display.

Features 
• Automatic Generation of Login Code and Password: For password change requests, the system automatically generates a login code and password based on the first two characters of the staffID, followed by the first three characters of the ticket creator name.
. • Easy Ticket Management: With the ability to create, search, and reopen tickets, the system helps you keep track of customer issues and resolutions. 
• Simple User Interface: The system operates entirely in the terminal or command prompt, making it easy to use for developers of all skill levels.
